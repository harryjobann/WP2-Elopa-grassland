_Datasets and code to produce species density estimates for grassland deployments from 2021 and 2024_



**Details**
- results: contains deployment calibration models, activity plots, parameters and density information
- data: combined dataframes for tagging, tracking and deployments, split between 2021 and 2024
- scripts: R code to prepare the data and run REM for 2021 & 2024. 2021 does not have a "data prep" script as data was already prepared for a previous analysis
- Grassland modelling: using domesticated animals and environmental covariates as predictors for wild species encounters.
